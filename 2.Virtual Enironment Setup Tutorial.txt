Step 1: Open Anaconda Navigator
         1.Launch Anaconda Navigator from your Start menu or applications list.
         2.You'll see a GUI interface with several options like Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, and Environments.

Step 2: Create a New Environment
         1.Navigate to the Environments tab on the left side of Anaconda Navigator.
         2.Click the Create button at the bottom.
         3.A dialog box will appear:
            Enter a name for your environment (e.g., ml_env).
            Choose the Python version you want (e.g., 3.9 or 3.10).
         4.Click Create and wait for the environment to be set up. It will download and install a basic set of libraries.

Step 3: Install Necessary Libraries
           1.Select your new environment from the list in the Environments tab.
           2.In the right-hand pane, click Channels (optional, for additional sources).
           3.Search for the libraries you need (e.g., pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, etc.):
                Use the Search Packages box.
                Check the box next to the desired libraries.
          4.Click Apply to install the selected packages.


Step 4: Enable VS Code Integration
         1.Go to the Home tab in Anaconda Navigator.
         2.If VS Code is not installed:
              Click Install under VS Code in Anaconda Navigator. This installs VS Code within Anaconda.
        3.Once installed, click Launch to open VS Code from Anaconda Navigator. This ensures VS Code can detect your Anaconda environments.



Step 5: Configure the Environment in VS Code
         Option 1: Using the Command Palette
          1.Open VS Code and press Ctrl + Shift + P (or Cmd + Shift + P on Mac) to open the Command Palette.
          2.Type and select Python: Select Interpreter.
          3.Look for your Anaconda environment in the list, e.g.,
          4 Automatically active your environment or run below command
                 conda activate ml_env
